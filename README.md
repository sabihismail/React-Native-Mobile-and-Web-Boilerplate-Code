# React Native Mobile and Web Boilerplate Code
This project is simple Boilerplate with minimal configuration
allowing for concurrent Web, Android, and iOS development with
an example index.js and App.js file.

All credits goes to the React Native for Web developers, this
is just to reduce the amount of configuration to allow for
modules like `react-scripts` from `react-native-web
to run alongside `react-native`.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` in the project directory.

That's it!

## Testing

To test concurrent deployment with real time development for
both Android and Web, execute `npm start`. 

To test just Android deployment, run `npm run start-android`.

Similarly, to test Web and iOS deployment, run `npm run start-web`, 
and `npm run start-ios` respectively.

## Built With
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Create Mobile Apps using JavaScript and React 
* [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) - React Native Web module
